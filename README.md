Flexagon
========

The goal of this project is to create [hexaflexagons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexagon#Hexaflexagons) from 3D printed triangles connected with rubber bands. Pictures could be attached to the sides of the triangles so that different hexaflexagon configurations display different images. 

Most hexaflexagons are made from folded paper. The advantage to making them from plastic triangles connected by rubber bands is that the result should be more durable and should allow images to be recreated more faithfully. The plastic triangles provide the durability and rigidity. The rubber bands create a stretchable folding joint which allows two connected triangles to be folded around a stack of triangles while remaining flat and in the proper position, something that isn't possible when folding paper around a stack of paper in a traditional folded paper flexagon. 

Status
======

I've successfully printed two triangle and connected them with a hairband. The joint bends and stretches as hoped, but the design could still use some refinement. See the [open issues] (https://github.com/brettle/Flexagon/issues) for details.

Files Provided
==============

`triangle.jscad` - A file that [an OpenJSCAD.org implementation](http://brettle.github.io/OpenJSCAD.org/) can use to generate an STL file that can be 3D printed.

`miracle.json` - The custom profile I'm currently using to print on a Makerbot Replicator 2.
